           <h3> About</h3>
           Firstly, this website consists of history of Nepal banknotes issued till the date.
           The use of paper money isn't very long in Nepal.The use of paper money came in existance 
           from 2002 B.S.(1945 and 1955) during the ruling period of King Tribhuvan. 
           Notes werenot put into circulation by a Central Bank which did not exist in Nepal at 
           that time. The issuing authority was the treasury which had the name Sadar Muluki Khana.
           Therefore, the notes of king Tribhuvan were not signed by a bank governor, but by a Khajanchee 
          (head of the treasury) who was a high Hindu priest in the same time. Nepal’s early paper currency 
           probably includes the only notes of the world which were signed by a high priest. 
           Domination of Rs 1, Rs 5 Rs 10 & Rs 100 were issued for the first time and the notes were printed by 
           the Indian Security Press in Nashik and do not have any security features, 
           except for the watermarks and the special paper on which they are printed.

           Since, Nepal Rastra Bank was established in 2013 B.S.(1956) during the ruling period of King Mahendra.
           The sign of governors came in existance after the establishment of Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB). 
           The first governor was Himalaya Shumsher JBR. Under king Mahendra the Nepalese Government became 
          “His Majesty’s Government” (expressed by "Shree 5 ko sarakar" which literally means
          “the government of the five times honoured”) and remained this way during the ruling period of 
           King Birendra and King Gyanendra. Two series of banknotes were issued during the rule of king Mahendra:
           In first series we can find King Mahendra in Nepali cultural dress and Nepali dhaka topi. Similarly, in 
           second series we can find him in military uniform. Domination of Rs 1, Rs 5, Rs 10, Rs 100, Rs 500 & Rs 1000
           were issued. For the first time domination of Rs 500 & Rs 1000 were issued in Nepal.

           During the ruling period of King Birendra two series of banknotes were issued. In first series we can
           find King Birendra in military uniform. Similarly in second series we can find him in Nepalese traditional
           crown adorned with feathers of the bird of paradise. Domination of Rs 1, Rs 2, Rs 5, Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 25,
           Rs 50, Rs 100, Rs 250, Rs 500 & Rs 1000 were issued. For the first time Rs 2, Rs 20 & Rs 50 were issued.
           And, on the special occasion note of Rs 25 & Rs 250 were issued for the first time in n Nepal.

           During the ruling period of King Gyanendra we can find the domination of Rs 5, Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 50, Rs 100,
           Rs 500 & Rs 1000 was issued. For the first time Polymor Rs 10 was also issued in Nepal. The domination of 
           Rs 1 and  Rs 2, and the special values of Rs 25 and  Rs 250 were not issued anymore.

           After 2062/63(2007/08) revolution Kings note were replaced by the image of Mount Everest. This reflects the historical
           change from kingdom to republic which took place in May 2008 in Nepal. Since, then we can find the image of Mount Everest
           in every Nepali rupees. The first issues of the 500 and 1000 rupees notes were printed on paper which still had the king's
           crowned portrait as a watermark in the "window" on the right part of the face of the notes. It was decided to print a red
           Rhododendron flower (Nepal's national flower) on top of the watermark. Notes of these denominations which were issued in 
           2009 and there after are printed on paper which has a rhododendron flower as watermark instead of the royal portrait and
           were therefore released without the additional overprint in red.
