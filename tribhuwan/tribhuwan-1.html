               This is the first Nepalese One rupee of Nepal which was issued from 1953 onwards during the 
               ruling period of King Tribhuwan. The notes werenot put into circulation by a Central Bank which wasn't
               established in Nepal at that time. The issuing authority was the treasury which had the name 
               Sadar Muluki Khana at that time.This money was printed in Nashik, India by Indian Security Press.
               At that time the notes of King Tribhuwan werenot signed by a bank governor, but by a Khajance
               (head of the treasury) called Pandit Narendra Raj Pandey. He was the high Hindu priest at that time.
